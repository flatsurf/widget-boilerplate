# Code Snippets for Notebook & Jupyter Lab Widgets

An assorted collection of TypeScript and Python Snippets that are frequently
repeated in Widget Code.

## Getting Started

To use these snippets it's certainly easiest to start from a package that already does so.

Otherwise, install the `widget-boilerplate` package from NPM and symlink the Python bits as you need them.

## Development

Build with `yarn build`, then link with `yarn link` and in your actual project
run `yarn link widget-boilerplate`.

## Deployment

To deploy a new version, bump the version number in `package.json` and `yarn publish`.
